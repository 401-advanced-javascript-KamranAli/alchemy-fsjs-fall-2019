Welcome to Career Track!
===

You have now been invited to the Career Track Canvas Repository. 

Note: 
- Like Bootcamp, there are new resources available that I need to integrate and link, which means that while week one is available, but I will be rolling out subsequent weeks as we go. 
- As there is some new material (and old material that has been dropped), I am also looking to make sure the timing and work load make sense. 

_If you can't access something, or anything doesn't look right, please let us know!_
And please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.

## Class GitHub Repository

Our class repository is https://github.com/alchemycodelab/alchemy-fsjs-fall-2019. This will be like a combined repository of the curriculum and reference material, plus in-class demos.

**For Monday**

## Class 00

In the morning, you will be working independently (Danny and Class TAs will be available) on `Class 00: Setup and Process`:

1. Go through the canvas assignments for `Class-00` and verify you have everything installed and running. You may want to start with objective #2 below and this will help flush out what you may not have.
1. Do the [`Lab 00 - Deployment Workshop`](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1705545/assignments/12463211). 
    - There is a video to watch and you need to code along to 
    validate that you have everything in place for a Lab Submission
    - The video presents many of the topics as "new", like testing and linting,
    that you have already been doing
    - The "starter code" is in the `curriculum/class-00/lab` folder in the class repository
    - This exercise will flush out most of the remaining setup tasks
1. Submit Readings assignments
    - For Career Track, you will be using the wiki feature of GitHub on your
    fork of the class repository. Add "notes" on readings like you 
    did for canvas discussions, but organize into pages on the class repo.
    This should enable you to refer back to your notes.
1. Do any additional Readings for `Class 01`
1. Feel free to get started on the day's Code Challenge, though you need to
grok getting jest and testing set up.
    - You will be creating a specific `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository for code challenges
    - You will need to write your own tests in Career Track!

## Class 01

We will start `Class-01` in the classroom at `1pm`. The lab will be shorter, and
we will start subsequent classes at `9am`.
